# ðŸ“Š Telco Customer Segmentation & Churn Prediction with SVC

A complete machine learning project using the Telco Customer Churn dataset to perform **customer segmentation and churn prediction** using **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** with a fully leak-proof pipeline and explainable ML techniques.

---

## ðŸš€ Project Goals

- Segment customers using churn behavior and feature patterns.
- Predict churn using Support Vector Classifier (SVC).
- Build a **leak-proof ML pipeline** using `Pipeline` and `ColumnTransformer`.
- Perform rigorous **EDA**, **feature engineering**, and **evaluation**.
- Use **SHAP** and **Permutation Importance** for explainability.
